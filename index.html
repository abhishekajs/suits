          <p id="type-para">
            For those who don't want to overthink the process, a classic fit
            suit is a way to go. This type of suit for men is comfortable in
            feel and unfettered in design, this suit style provides
            breathability without resorting to a loose or unkept aesthetic-they
            don-t call it "classic" for nothing.

          <p id="type-para">
            If you don't think you can pull off the slim fit suit just yet, but
            want to exude a heightened sartorial sensibility, by all means,
            consider the modern fit suit. These types of suits for men hover
            squarely in the realm between slim fit and a classic fit.

          <p id="type-para">
            One look at a shawl lapel and its smooth, uninterrupted lining, and
            you're already picturing an elegant black-tie affair. That's because
            this type of suit lapel is more or less exclusively found on formal
            wear like tuxedos and fancy dinner jackets.

          <p id="type-para">
            Among types of men's suits, the single-breasted suit is the most
            ubiquitous. The easiest way to spot one is to look for the inclusion
            of either one, two or three buttons along the seam, or just observe
            what about 99% of professional men wear to work to every day.
