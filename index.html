          <p>
            For those who don't want to overthink the process, a classic fit
            suit is a way to go. This type of suit for men is comfortable in
            feel and unfettered in design, this suit style provides
            breathability without resorting to a loose or unkempt aesthetic-they
            don-t call it "classic" for nothing. An easy choice if you want
            something that's perfect for the office Monday to Friday, but with a
            suit jacket that can be put with chinos for a smart casual weekend
            look. It's safe to say, classic suits will never go out of style.

          <p>
            If you don't think you can pull off the slim fit suit just yet, but
            want to exude a heightened sartorial sensibility, by all means,
            consider the modern fit suit. These types of suits for men hover
            squarely in the realm between slim fit and a classic fit. It thereby
            delivers a tight look with breathing room to spare. If you get the
            material and the accessories right then you can make this work for
            just about any occasion. Modern suit styles are made to conquer any
            outing, from casual to dressy.

            One look at a shawl lapel and its smooth, uninterrupted lining, and
            you're already picturing an elegant black-tie affair. That's because
            this type of suit lapel is more or less exclusively found on formal
            wear like tuxedos and fancy dinner jackets. Entailed in the shawl
            lapel's aesthetic is a timeless sense of class and distinction.
            These lapels provide a welcoming complement to most men's formal
            wear styles.

          <p>
            Among types of men's suits, the single-breasted suit is the most
            ubiquitous. The easiest way to spot one is to look for the inclusion
            of either one, two or three buttons along the seam, or just observe
            what about 99% of professional men wear to work to every day. By
            virtue of the single row of buttons, a single-breasted suit usually
            exudes a narrower and tighter appearance. These suits are most
            frequently paired with notch lapels.
